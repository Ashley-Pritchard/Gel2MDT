FUNCTION

This tool is designed to generate Mutation Reports for findings of the 100,000 Genome Project in a format that can be uploaded to StarLIMS (the lab information management system). 


DESCRIPTION

Gel2MDT is software that facilitates the management of results generated by Genomics England (GEL) for the 100,000 genome project. The software communicates with GEL to provide an SQL database of patient and genetic data. The LiftOver tool is designed to  run after the proband_sci.py script written by Natasha Pinto. The proband_sci.py script queries the database to generate a csv file of proband information. This file is named 'proband_file_*.csv' where the astrix is replaced by the date the script is run in the format yyy-mm-dd. This file can be uploaded to StarLIMS to activate investigations. 

The input for the LiftOver tool is the Gel ids provided in the first column of the 'proband.file_*.csv' file. A csv file for each Gel id is generated and named 'Gel2MDT_Export_*_MutationReport.csv' where the astrix is replaced with the respective Gel id. An SQL query populates each of the files with the following information from the Gel2MDT database: (1) hg38 Reference Position (2) Gene, (3) Reference Sequence, (4) Alternative Sequence, (5) Chr, (6) Genotype, (7) Genomic Coordinate, (8) Alamut, (9) Tier and (10) Reference Genome. If no variant information is associated with the gel id and an empty dataframe is created as a result, the csv file is deleted and the gel id added to an 'empty_files.txt' file. 

Variant interpretation work in Oxford Medical Genomics Laboratories (OMGL) is currently set up for variants reported in genomic build 37. However, approximately 95% of variants generated by GEL are reported as build 38. The pyliftover tool (https://pypi.org/project/pyliftover/) has been incorporated into this script to convert these coordinates. 

The script then reformats the csv files so they are consistent with the required Mutation Report input for StarLIMS. The date and time of the run is also added. A directory is created and named according to the date the script is run in the format yyy-mm-dd and the orginal 'proband_file_*.csv' file, 'empty_files.txt' file and all 'Gel2MDT_Export_*_MutationReport.csv' files are transferred into it. 


INSTALLATION

This tool requires Python (tested on version 3.7.2 in a conda environment). Python can be downloaded here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
It is also necessary to install the following: 
pyscopg2 using 'pip install psycopg2' 
pandas using 'pip install pandas' 
requests using 'pip install requests'
pyliftover using 'easy_install pyliftover'


USER GUIDE

This tool must be provided with a single 'proband_file_*.csv' input file. The tool assumes this file will be found in the same dirctory as the script. No other files with this name format should be in the directory. 

All files associated with the run will be transfered to a directory named according to the date of the run in the format yyy-mm-dd. There should not be another directory with this name.
